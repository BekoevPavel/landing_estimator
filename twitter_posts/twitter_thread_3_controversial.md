gonna say something that'll piss people off:

if you're still doing software estimates manually in 2025, you're wasting everyone's time

and you're probably wrong by 50% minimum

thread on why we need to stop pretending

---

real talk: every estimate is just a guess with confidence

"this'll take 2 weeks" actually means "idk but 2 weeks sounds reasonable"

we've been doing professional theater instead of actual estimation

---

devs miss deadlines like 60-80% of the time according to most studies

not because we're bad developers

because humans are terrible at predicting complex system behavior

we just... suck at this specific skill

---

people say "AI can't understand business context"

ok but it doesn't need to?

it needs to understand technical debt, API complexity, testing overhead, integration hell

and honestly AI is already better at that than most senior devs I know

---

you say "simple CRUD app, 2 days"

but AI counts:
- 8 REST endpoints
- auth middleware
- state management
- error handling
- unit tests
- deployment config

then says 5 days

guess which estimate is right

---

I built a system where AI agents argue with each other about estimates

because one developer has blind spots
two developers have groupthink
but two AI agents with different system prompts? they'll actually fight

and somehow that gets you closer to reality

---

hot take part 2:

estimation as a job skill is dead in like 3 years max

same way manual testing died
same way writing deployment scripts died
same way some code review is dying

this is happening whether you like it or not

---

"but experience and nuance!"

my AI learned from 6 years of my fuckups plus thousands of project patterns

your experience is one person's career
AI's training is thousands of careers

which one probably knows more edge cases?

---

prediction: by 2027 every agency has AI estimation

the ones that don't?

they're losing bids to shops that can estimate accurately in 1 hour instead of 1 day

economics gonna economics

I'm still building this out

no product link yet, just documenting the journey

follow along if you want to see if I'm right or full of shit
