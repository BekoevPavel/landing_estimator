# Smurfs Story Tweets

**Tweet 1: The Setup**
you know how smurfs live in your TV and make it work?
imagine if smurfs lived in your Jira
Senior Backend Smurf
Senior Frontend Smurf
Senior QA Smurf
they analyze your tasks and argue about estimates
I'm building this

---

**Tweet 2: Meet The Team**
meet my Jira smurfs:
@SeniorBackendSmurf - knows every API pain
@SeniorFrontendSmurf - counts every pixel
@SeniorQASmurf - finds every edge case
they live in your project
they argue with each other
you get accurate estimates

---

**Tweet 3: How It Works**
My Smurf work inside smth like Jira, PM Tool
how my smurfs work:
you create a task
Backend Smurf: "this is 8 hours"
Frontend Smurf: "BS, the UI alone is 12 hours"
QA Smurf: "add 6 for testing edge cases"
they fight until they agree
you approve the number

---

**Tweet 4: The Magic**
the magic of Jira smurfs:
they read your task
they decompose it automatically
they argue like real senior devs
"that's too optimistic"
"you forgot auth middleware"
"what about error handling?"
then give you real numbers

---

**Tweet 5: No More Chasing**
current life:
chase backend dev for estimate
chase frontend dev for estimate
schedule meeting
argue for 2 hours
still wrong

smurf life:
create task
smurfs argue in comments
you approve
done in 10 min

**Tweet 6: Senior Smurfs**
why Senior smurfs?
junior smurf: "yeah 5 hours sounds good"
senior smurf: "did you count DB migrations?"
senior smurf 2: "what about the auth layer?"
senior smurf 3: "testing? deployment?"
seniors argue = accurate estimates

---

**Tweet 7: Living In Jira**
imagine opening Jira tomorrow
little smurfs already analyzed your backlog
decomposed big tasks
estimated everything
left comments arguing with each other
you just approve and assign
this is what I'm building

---

**Tweet 8: The Vision**
the vision:
smurfs live in your Jira like they live in your TV
they make your project management work
you don't see them working
you just see results
estimates done, tasks decomposed
building this right now

---

**Tweet 9: Smurf Argument**
actual smurf conversation in my Jira:
Backend: "REST API, 6 hours"
Frontend: "you forgot WebSocket for real-time"
Backend: "fine, 10 hours"
QA: "add 4 for integration tests"
Final: 14 hours
this is better than our team meetings

**Tweet 10: Why Smurfs**
why I call them smurfs:
- small but powerful
- each has a specialty
- work together as team
- live inside your system
- do magic when you're not looking
- make things work
building AI smurfs for Jira

**Tweet 11: The Dream**
the dream:
Monday morning
open Jira
smurfs already:
- analyzed new tickets
- decomposed complex tasks
- estimated everything
- flagged risky items
you just review and approve
building this

**Tweet 12: Real Seniors**
my smurfs are real seniors:
they've seen thousands of projects
they know auth takes longer than you think
they know "simple CRUD" is never simple
they know testing is always forgotten
that's why they argue
that's why they're accurate
