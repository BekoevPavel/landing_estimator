**Tweet 1:**
built AI estimation where agents argue
sounds dumb but works
one LLM = agrees with everything
multiple agents = they fight
that gets you real numbers

**Tweet 2:**
the setup:
2 Flutter agents (optimist vs pessimist)
2 backend agents (same)
risk analyst (paranoid)
orchestrator (LangGraph)
they have different prompts so they actually disagree

**Tweet 3:**
Agent 1: "auth is 5 hours"
Agent 2: "biometric + JWT + OAuth = 20 hours"
orchestrator weighs complexity
lands at 14 hours
actually accurate

**Tweet 4:**
GPT-4 was useless for this
Claude Sonnet 4.5 gets it
technical debt, testing, integration
all the stuff that kills timelines
still building, follow for updates
