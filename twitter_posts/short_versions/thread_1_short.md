**Tweet 1:**
6 years of software estimates
overestimate = lose client
underestimate = free weekends
get it right = nobody cares
here's what I built to fix this

**Tweet 2:**
my agency: 3-4 people, full days on estimates
still missed deadlines
tried ChatGPT - useless
but gave me an idea

**Tweet 3:**
built AI team that argues with itself
Frontend agents fight each other
backend agents call BS
risk analyst is paranoid
they disagree = better estimates

**Tweet 4:**
My AI team asks questions → I answer → they debate → estimate
1 hour vs full day
still building, follow for updates
what's your worst estimate?
mine: "2 weeks" → took 2 months
