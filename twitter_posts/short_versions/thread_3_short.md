# Thread 3 - Short (14 lines max per tweet)

**Tweet 1:**
hot take:
manual software estimates in 2025 = wasting time
every estimate is just a confident guess
we've been doing theater

**Tweet 2:**
devs miss deadlines 60-80% of time
not because we're bad
because humans suck at predicting complexity
AI doesn't forget edge cases
AI counts everything

**Tweet 3:**
you: "simple CRUD, 2 days"
AI counts: 8 endpoints, auth, state, errors, tests, deployment
AI: "5 days"
guess who's right

**Tweet 4:**
I built agents that argue about estimates
one dev = blind spots
two devs = groupthink
two AI agents = actual fight
gets you closer to reality

**Tweet 5:**
prediction: by 2027 every agency uses AI estimation
the ones that don't lose bids
I'm still building this out
follow to see if I'm right or full of shit
