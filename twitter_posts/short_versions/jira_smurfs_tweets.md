# Jira Smurfs / AI Team Tweets

---

**Tweet 1: The Vision**
imagine little AI smurfs living in your Jira
you tag @BackendAgent in a comment
it analyzes, decomposes, estimates
no more "hey can you estimate this" meetings
building this right now
follow along

---

**Tweet 2: Tag & Done**
current process:
1. write task
2. ping backend dev
3. wait 2 days
4. get estimate
5. repeat for frontend

my process:
1. write task
2. tag @BackendSmurf
3. get estimate in 5 min
building this

**Tweet 3: Jira Killer**
what if your Jira had AI agents you could tag?

@FrontendAgent analyze this UI task
@BackendAgent estimate the API work
@RiskAnalyst what could go wrong?

all in comments, instant replies
this is what I'm building

---

**Tweet 4: No More Meetings**
"can we schedule a call to estimate this?"
no
tag @EstimationAgent in Jira
get breakdown in 5 minutes
skip the meeting
save 2 hours
this is the future

---

**Tweet 5: Lazy PM Dream**
I'm building a lazy PM's dream:
instead of chasing devs for estimates
just tag AI agents in new PM Tool
@SeniorBackendAgent do the work
@SeniorFrontendAgent check this
they argue, you get numbers
follow for updates

---

**Tweet 6: The Smurfs**
my Jira now has smurfs:

@BackendSmurf - estimates API work
@FrontendSmurf - estimates UI complexity
@RiskSmurf - finds what could break
@DecomposeSmurf - breaks big tasks down

they live in comments
they do the boring work
building this

---

**Tweet 7: Simple**
before: "hey team, 2 hour estimation meeting tomorrow"
after: "@EstimationTeam" in Jira comment
that's it
that's the whole product
still building, follow along

---

**Tweet 8: Real Talk**
real talk:
I don't want to ask devs to estimate
they don't want to estimate
nobody wants estimation meetings
so I'm building AI team to do it
everyone wins
follow for updates

---

**Tweet 9: The Dream**
the dream:
open Jira task
type "@AITeam estimate this"
get:
- task decomposition
- hour breakdown
- risk analysis
- complexity score
all in 5 minutes
building this right now

---

**Tweet 10: Why Smurfs**
why I call them smurfs:
small, helpful, do specific jobs
backend smurf knows backend
frontend smurf knows UI
risk smurf is paranoid
they work together
you just watch
building this Jira killer

---

**Tweet 11: Tag System**
imagine this in your Jira:

comment: "@BackendAgent how long for this API?"

reply (2 min later):
"3 endpoints, auth middleware, DB schema
estimate: 16 hours
risk: external API dependency
suggest: break into 3 subtasks"

building this

---

**Tweet 12: Future**
2024: chase devs for estimates
2025: tag AI agents in Jira
2026: estimates are automatic

I'm building the 2025 version
follow along or wait for everyone else to ship first
your call

---

**Tweet 13: Honest**
honest take:
estimation meetings are dead time
devs hate them
PMs hate them
clients hate waiting
AI smurfs in Jira fix this
tag, get answer, move on
building it now

---

**Tweet 14: The Pitch**
Jira but with AI teammates

you tag them like real people
they respond in comments
they estimate, decompose, analyze
they argue with each other
you approve the final number

sounds crazy but it works
building in public, follow
